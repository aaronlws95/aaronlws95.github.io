#           is our entry to the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2023">GMTK Game Jam 2023</a> with the theme "Reversed
#           Roles". The concept of the game is that you are
#           playing as the environment in a turn based tactics game instead of the units. Your goal is to keep peace and
#           prevent forests from destruction. The game was made over a weekend so we ended up not being able to implement
#           all the features we wanted to. You can check the game out <a
