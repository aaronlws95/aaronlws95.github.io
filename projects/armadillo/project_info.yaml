summary: | 
        <p><b>ARMadillo</b> is a cross-platform ARM emulator for assembling and simulating the ARM7TDMI instruction set built as part of the High Level Programming EE3-22 module at Imperial College London in 2017. My role in the project was the implementation of the ARM7TDMI instruction sets and emulator. I was also responsible for writing tests for the emulator functions. You can check it out on <a class="text" href="https://github.com/aaronlws95/hlp-project-2017">GitHub</a>!</p>
        <p>ARMadillo was a collaborative effort in a team of 4 people. It was developed in F# with the GUI developed using HTML, CSS, and, JavaScript and draws inspiration from <a class="text" href="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/">VisUAL</a>.</p>
