summary: | 
  <b>Katapat</b> is a Malay language version of the popular word guessing game <a class="text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle">Wordle</a>. During the development of the game, I assisted in procuring Malay words to add to the game's dictionary. I also wrote scripts to cross reference the words with the official Malay dictionary <a class="text" href="https://prpm.dbp.gov.my/">(Kamus Dewan)</a> to ensure their eligibility. You can play the game <a class="text" href="https://www.projecteugene.com/katapat.html">here</a>!
