  <p><b>Super Miami</b> is a top-down shooter which combines aspects of <a class="text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotline_Miami">Hotline Miami</a> (top-down shooter) with <a class="text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhot">Superhot</a> (time within the game only progresses when the player moves). This game was developed during my time at the Game Development Society in Imperial as a collaboration between 2 people. </p>
