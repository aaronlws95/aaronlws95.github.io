summary: | 
  <p><b>Heat Pipe Cooling Design System for Osram LED Luminaires</b> was developed as a collaborative effort in a team of 3 people while we were studying A-Levels. The project was carried out to participate in The Great Lab Challenge 2014 sponsored by Osram. The goal of this project was to propose a novel design for heat sinks in LEDs. During the project, each of us contributed to the research. I was also given the responsibility of designing the diagrams. <a class="text" href="doc/aaronlow_tgl.pdf">Check out the report!</a></p>
