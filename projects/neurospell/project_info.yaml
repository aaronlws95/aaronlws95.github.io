summary: |
  <p><b>NeuroSpell</b> is a low-cost brain computing interface that allows people suffering from motor impairment to type on computers by looking at an on-screen keyboard. The project was developed in a team of 7 people. My role in this project was developing the software in Python and interfacing with <a class="text" href="http://openvibe.inria.fr/">OpenViBE</a>.

  <p>NeuroSpell consists of an EEG headset which records brain signals and a processing box which amplifies and filters the signal before being sent to our software interface. On the software side, the signal is processed with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to obtain the relevant signals which are generated by the user looking at a specific key on our flashing on-screen keyboard.</p>
