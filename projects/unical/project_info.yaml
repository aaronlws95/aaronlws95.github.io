summary: | 
  <b>UniCal: a Single-Branch Transformer-Based Model for Camera-to-LiDAR Calibration and Validation</b> is a novel architecture for carrying out camera-to-LiDAR calibration and validation leveraging self-attention mechanisms using a <a class="text" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Transformer</a>-based network. The work was carried out while working with the Calibration Team at <a class="text" href="https://motional.com/">Motional</a>.
