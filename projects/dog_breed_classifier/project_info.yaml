summary: | 
  <p>The <b>Dog Breed Classifier</b> was developed as as part of the <a class="text" href="https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025">Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree</a>. For the project, I trained a convolutional neural network with transfer learning to classify the dog breeds while experimenting with different models and parameters. Additionally, I also developed a web application to run the classifier.
