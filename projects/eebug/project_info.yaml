summary: | 
  <p><b>EEBug</b> is a line following robot developed as part of my first year project at Imperial College London in 2014. The project was carried out in a team of 5 people where I was designated project manager. I also contributed to the PSPICE simulation and implementing the line following algorithm in C.</p>
  <p>The EEBug is controlled by an Atmel Attiny 85. To detect the line, the EEBug uses IR LEDs and detectors. The motors are driven using pulse width modulation. A voltage regulator is also implemented to prevent noisy voltage signals from being sent to the microcontroller.</p>
